File: docKUalik.info,  Node: GNU ELPA,  Next: GNU Guix,  Up: Installation

1.1 GNU ELPA
============

Ement.el is published in GNU ELPA (http://elpa.gnu.org/), so it may be
installed in Emacs with the command ‘M-x package-install RET ement RET’.
This is the recommended way to install Ement.el, as it will install the
current stable release.


File: docKUalik.info,  Node: GNU Guix,  Next: Debian,  Prev: GNU ELPA,  Up: Installation

1.2 GNU Guix
============

Ement.el is also available in GNU Guix (https://guix.gnu.org/) as
‘emacs-ement’.


File: docKUalik.info,  Node: Debian,  Next: Git master,  Prev: GNU Guix,  Up: Installation

1.3 Debian
==========

Ement.el is also available in Debian as elpa-ement
(https://packages.debian.org/elpa-ement).


File: docKUalik.info,  Node: Git master,  Next: Manual,  Prev: Debian,  Up: Installation

1.4 Git master
==============

The ‘master’ branch of the Git repository is intended to be usable at
all times; only minor bugs are expected to be found in it before a new
stable release is made.  To install from this, it is recommended to use
quelpa-use-package (https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package), like
this:

     ;; Install and load `quelpa-use-package'.
     (package-install 'quelpa-use-package)
     (require 'quelpa-use-package)

     ;; Install Ement.
     (use-package ement
       :quelpa (ement :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/ement.el"))

   One might also use systems like Straight
(https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el) (which is also used by
DOOM (https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)) to install from Git, but
the author cannot offer support for them.


File: docKUalik.info,  Node: Manual,  Prev: Git master,  Up: Installation

1.5 Manual
==========

Ement.el is intended to be installed with Emacs’s package system, which
will ensure that the required autoloads are generated, etc.  If you
choose to install it manually, you’re on your own.

     supported, so you may call the command again to connect to another
     account.
  2. Wait for initial sync to complete (which can take a few
     moments–initial sync JSON requests can be large).
  3. Use these commands:
        • ‘ement-list-rooms’ to view the list of joined rooms.
        • ‘ement-view-room’ to view a room’s buffer, selected with
          completion.

          prefix, un-ignore).
        • ‘ement-room-set-message-format’ to set a room’s message format
          buffer-locally.
        • ‘ement-directory’ to view a room directory.

2.2 Tips
========

   • Desktop notifications are enabled by default for events that
     mention the local user.  They can also be shown for all events in
     rooms with open buffers.
   • Send messages in Org mode format by customizing the option
     ‘ement-room-send-message-filter’ (which enables Org format by
     default), or by calling ‘ement-room-compose-org’ in a compose
     buffer (which enables it for a single message).  Then Org-formatted
     messages are automatically converted and sent as HTML-formatted
     messages (with the Org syntax as the plain-text fallback).  You can
     send syntax such as:
        • Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
        • Links
        • Tables
        • Source blocks (including results with ‘:exports both’)
        • Footnotes (okay, that might be pushing it, but you can!)
        • And, generally, anything that Org can export to HTML
   • Starting in the room list buffer, by pressing ‘SPC’ repeatedly, you
     can cycle through and read all rooms with unread buffers.  (If a
     room doesn’t have a buffer, it will not be included.)
   • Room buffers and the room-list buffer can be bookmarked in Emacs,
     i.e.  using ‘C-x r m’.  This is especially useful with Burly
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el): you can arrange an Emacs
     frame with several room buffers displayed at once, use
     ‘burly-bookmark-windows’ to bookmark the layout, and then you can
     restore that layout and all of the room buffers by opening the
     bookmark, rather than having to manually arrange them every time
     you start Emacs or change the window configuration.
   • Images and other files can be uploaded to rooms using
     drag-and-drop.
   • You can customize settings in the ‘ement’ group.
        • *Note:* ‘setq’ should not be used for certain options, because
          it will not call the associated setter function.  Users who
          have an aversion to the customization system may experience
          problems.

* Displaying symbols and emojis::


File: docKUalik.info,  Node: Displaying symbols and emojis,  Up: Tips

2.2.1 Displaying symbols and emojis
-----------------------------------

Emacs may not display certain symbols and emojis well by default.  Based
on this question and answer
(https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/62049/override-the-default-font-for-emoji-characters),
you may find that the simplest way to fix this is to install an
appropriate font, like Noto Emoji
(https://www.google.com/get/noto/#emoji-zsye), and then use this Elisp
code:

     (setf use-default-font-for-symbols nil)
     (set-fontset-font t 'unicode "Noto Emoji" nil 'append)

2.3 Encrypted room support through Pantalaimon
==============================================

Ement.el doesn’t support encrypted rooms natively, but it can be used
transparently with the E2EE-aware reverse proxy daemon Pantalaimon
(https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon/).  After configuring it
according to its documentation, call ‘ement-connect’ with the
appropriate hostname and port, like:

     (ement-connect :uri-prefix "http://localhost:8009")

3 Rationale
***********

Why write a new Emacs Matrix client when there is already
matrix-client.el (https://github.com/alphapapa/matrix-client.el), by the
same author, no less?  A few reasons:

   • ‘matrix-client’ uses an older version of the Matrix spec, r0.3.0,
     with a few elements of r0.4.0 grafted in.  Bringing it up to date
     with the current version of the spec, r0.6.1, would be more work
     than to begin with the current version.  Ement.el targets r0.6.1
     from the beginning.
   • ‘matrix-client’ does not use Matrix’s lazy-loading feature (which
     was added to the specification later), so initial sync requests can
     take a long time for the server to process and can be large
     (sometimes tens of megabytes of JSON for the client to process!).
     Ement.el uses lazy-loading, which significantly improves
     performance.
   • ‘matrix-client’ automatically makes buffers for every room a user
     has joined, even if the user doesn’t currently want to watch a
     room.  Ement.el opens room buffers on-demand, improving performance
     by not having to insert events into buffers for rooms the user
     isn’t watching.
   • ‘matrix-client’ was developed without the intention of publishing
     it to, e.g.  MELPA or ELPA.  It has several dependencies, and its
     code does not always install or compile cleanly due to
     macro-expansion issues (apparently depending on the user’s Emacs
     config).  Ement.el is designed to have minimal dependencies outside
     of Emacs (currently only one, ‘plz’, which could be imported into
     the project), and every file is linted and compiles cleanly using
     makem.sh (https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh).
   • ‘matrix-client’ uses EIEIO, probably unnecessarily, since few, if
     any, of the benefits of EIEIO are realized in it.  Ement.el uses
     structs instead.
   • ‘matrix-client’ uses bespoke code for inserting messages into
     buffers, which works pretty well, but has a few minor bugs which
     are difficult to track down.  Ement.el uses Emacs’s built-in (and
     perhaps little-known) ‘ewoc’ library, which makes it much simpler
     and more reliable to insert and update messages in buffers, and
     enables the development of advanced UI features more easily.
   • ‘matrix-client’ was, to a certain extent, designed to imitate other
     messaging apps.  The result is, at least when used with the
     ‘matrix-client-frame’ command, fairly pleasing to use, but isn’t
     especially "Emacsy."  Ement.el is intended to better fit into
     Emacs’s paradigms.
   • ‘matrix-client’’s long name makes for long symbol names, which
     makes for tedious, verbose code.  ‘ement’ is easy to type and makes
     for concise, readable code.
   • The author has learned much since writing ‘matrix-client’ and hopes
     to write simpler, more readable, more maintainable code in
     Ement.el.  It’s hoped that this will enable others to contribute
     more easily.

   Note that, while ‘matrix-client’ remains usable, and probably will
for some time to come, Ement.el has now surpassed it in every way.  The
only reason to choose ‘matrix-client’ instead is if one is using an
older version of Emacs that isn’t supported by Ement.el.

File: docKUalik.info,  Node: 04,  Next: 031,  Prev: 041,  Up: Changelog

4.2 0.4
=======

*Additions*
   • Option ‘ement-room-unread-only-counts-notifications’, now enabled
     by default, causes rooms’ unread status to be determined only by
     their notification counts (which are set by the server and depend
     on rooms’ notification settings).
   • Command ‘ement-room-set-notification-state’ sets a room’s
     notification state (imitating Element’s user-friendly presets).
   • Room buffers’ Transient menus show the room’s notification state
     (imitating Element’s user-friendly presets).
   • Command ‘ement-set-display-name’ sets the user’s global
     displayname.
   • Command ‘ement-room-set-display-name’ sets the user’s displayname
     in a room (which is also now displayed in the room’s Transient
     menu).
   • Column ‘Notifications’ in the ‘ement-taxy-room-list’ buffer shows
     rooms’ notification state.
   • Option ‘ement-interrupted-sync-hook’ allows customization of how
     sync interruptions are handled.  (Now, by default, a warning is
     displayed instead of merely a message.)

   *Changes*
   • When a room’s read receipt is updated, the room’s buffer is also
     marked as unmodified.  (In concert with the new option, this makes
     rooms’ unread status more intuitive.)

   *Fixes*
   • Binding of command ‘ement-forget-room’ in room buffers.
   • Highlighting of ‘@room’ mentions.


File: docKUalik.info,  Node: 031,  Next: 03,  Prev: 04,  Up: Changelog

4.4 0.3
=======

*Additions*
   • Command ‘ement-directory’ shows a server’s room directory.
   • Command ‘ement-directory-search’ searches a server’s room
     directory.
   • Command ‘ement-directory-next’ fetches the next batch of rooms in a
     directory.
   • Command ‘ement-leave-room’ accepts a ‘FORCE-P’ argument
     (interactively, with prefix) to leave a room without prompting.
   • Command ‘ement-forget-room’ accepts a ‘FORCE-P’ argument
     (interactively, with prefix) to also leave the room, and to forget
     it without prompting.
   • Option ‘ement-notify-mark-frame-urgent-predicates’ marks the frame
     as urgent when (by default) a message mentions the local user or
     "@room" and the message’s room has an open buffer.

   *Changes*
   • Minor improvements to date/time headers.

   *Fixes*
   • Command ‘ement-describe-room’ for rooms without topics.
   • Improve insertion of old messages around existing timestamp
     headers.
   • Reduce D-Bus notification system check timeout to 2 seconds (from
     the default of 25).
   • Compatibility with Emacs 27.

File: docKUalik.info,  Node: 02,  Next: 014,  Prev: 021,  Up: Changelog

4.6 0.2
=======

*Changes*
   • Read receipts are re-enabled.  (They’re now implemented with a
     global idle timer rather than ‘window-scroll-functions’, which
     sometimes caused a strange race condition that could cause Emacs to
     become unresponsive or crash.)
   • When determining whether a room is considered unread, non-message
     events like membership changes, reactions, etc.  are ignored.  This
     fixes a bug that caused certain rooms that had no message events
     (like some bridged rooms) to appear as unread when they shouldn’t
     have.  But it’s unclear whether this is always preferable (e.g.
     one might want a member leaving a room to cause it to be marked
     unread), so this is classified as a change rather than simply a
     fix, and more improvements may be made to this in the future.
     (Fixes #97 (https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/97).
     Thanks to Julien Roy (https://github.com/MrRoy) for reporting and
     testing.)
   • The ‘ement-taxy-room-list’ view no longer automatically refreshes
     the list if the region is active in the buffer.  (This allows the
     user to operate on multiple rooms without the contents of the
     buffer changing before completing the process.)

   *Fixes*
   • Links to only rooms (as opposed to links to events in rooms) may be
     activated to join them.
   • Read receipts mark the last completely visible event (rather than
     one that’s only partially displayed).
   • Prevent error when a room avatar image fails to load.
